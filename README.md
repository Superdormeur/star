Question 2.
1. How to check if a video started during the time window?

    - Check timespan, (what is the value if it's the first time a token is sent for this video session?)
    - Check sessionDuration (should be less than 5 minutes if a new video session is started)
2. Implement it
   I did not have to implement it.
